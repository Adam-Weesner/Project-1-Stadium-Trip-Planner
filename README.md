# Project-1-Stadium-Trip-Planner
School project developed solely by me. Allows the user to plan a trip across the United States to football stadiums. Along the way, a user can buy souvenirs at each stadium and receive a reciept at the end of their trip. There is also an administrator component where users can add, modify, or delete stadiums or souviners.
